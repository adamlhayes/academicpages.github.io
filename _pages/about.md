I'm a PhD student at the University of Washington's Evans School of Public Policy and Governance focused primarily on topics related to environmental and natural resource economics and environmental policy and management. I grew up in Colorado, and earned my B.A. from the University of Colorado in economics, political science, and international affairs. After graduating, I worked as a data specialist for Alpine Achievement Systems in Englewood, CO for six years, helping school districts in Colorado, New Mexico, and Wisconsin to interpret and effectively use their student achievement data. But, my primary interest has always been environmental policy. To pursue that interest, I earned a M.S. in energy economics from Colorado School of Mines in Golden while continuing to work. I began my PhD studies in 2014 with support from the IGERT Program on Ocean Change, and I couldn't be happier to be focused full-time on issues of environmental economics and policy. 

I'm currently in my final year of my PhD studies - which means writing the dissertation. My dissertation chapters are focused on different aspects of decentralized markets in policy and management contexts. In one chapter, I'm modeling trading behavior in the halibut and sablefish (black cod) fishing quota markets in Alaska. In another chapter, I estimate the implicit tradeoffs that local governments make between existing relationships and advisor quality when choosing which advisor to use when issuing debt. 

Along with my dissertation, I also research networks of interactivity among stakeholders in the environmental policy process and in complex environmental
governance situations; including, network measurement challenges, analytical techniques, and the relationship between networked stakeholders and policy outcomes. This involves scraping web data for network information between policy actors, and modeling tie formation activity in these networks. 

When I'm not working on my various research projects, you can usually find me exploring Seattle or hiking with my wife Alex in the surrounding mountains or coasts.
