I'm a Postdoctoral Scholar at the University of Washington School of Marine and Environmental Affairs where I work with Professor Sunny Jardine. My current projects include modeling recreational angling and lake stocking in Wisconsin, researching the effects of harmful algal blooms on the California Dungeness Crab Fishery, and modeling the trading decisions of halibut quotaholders in the Alaska IFQ fishery. Most of my current work involves fisheries, but I'm also broadly interested in climate change, marine policy, and environmental governance. Some of my previous research has looked at networks of interactivity among stakeholders in the environmental policy process and in complex environmental governance situations; including, network measurement challenges, analytical techniques, and the relationship between networked stakeholders and policy outcomes, in order to better understand how network processes might change as the network matures. This has involved scraping web data for network information between policy actors, and modeling tie formation activity in these networks. 

I received my doctoral in public policy and management from the Evans School of Public Policy and Governance in December 2019, supported by fellowships from the IGERT Program on Ocean Change and the National Marine Fisheries Service and Sea Grant. While I currently live in Seattle and study marine issues, I grew up far from the ocean in Colorado, where I earned my B.A. from the University of Colorado in economics, political science, and international affairs. After graduating, I worked as a data specialist for Alpine Achievement Systems in Englewood, Colorado for six years, helping school districts in Colorado, New Mexico, and Wisconsin to interpret and effectively use their student achievement data. But, my primary interest has always been environmental policy. I earned a M.S. in energy economics from Colorado School of Mines in Golden, Colorado while continuing to work full-time. I began my PhD studies in 2014 with support from the IGERT Program on Ocean Change, and I couldn't be happier to be focused full-time on issues of environmental economics and policy. 

When I'm not working on my various research projects, you can usually find me exploring Seattle or hiking with my wife Alex in the surrounding mountains or coasts.
