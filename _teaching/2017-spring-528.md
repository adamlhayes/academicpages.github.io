The second course in a two-course quantitative methods sequence that each Masters of Public Affairs student at the University of Washington's Evans School is required to take. Students come from diverse academic backgrounds with a wide range of previous quantitative analysis experience. Because no previous statistics or programming experience is required the two-course sequence is designed to allow students with no prior background knowledge to gain the ability to evaluate and produce quantitative analyses by the end of the year.
