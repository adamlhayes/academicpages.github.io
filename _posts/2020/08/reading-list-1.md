John Whitehead who runs the [environmental economics blog](https://www.env-econ.net/) had a link to a [recent comment he authored](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2020.106768) published in [*Ecological Economics*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/ecological-economics) in response to a paper written by William Desvouges, Kristy Mathews, and Kenneth Train, and published in *Land Economics* back in 2015.  I finally got around today to reading the original paper and its follow-ups. You know - for fun. 

## Overview
The original paper tests to see whether a contingent valuation survey passes the adding-up test for willingness-to-pay. 

## Background
Contingent valuation is a survey method designed to elicit preferences of respondents and using those responses to construct an estimate of how much certain things are worth. This is particularly useful for environmental economics where we're usually working with wildlife abundance or forest coverage, which doesn't have a market price associated with it, but we would like to figure out how much it's worth to everyone. Contingent valuation usually asks people to choose between a menu of different options and state which one they would most prefer. 

An example simplified from a paper by [Lew, et al. (2010)](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.5950/0738-1360-25.2.133?casa_token=vs0FyYT2eREAAAAA%3AXOIdQcS-YpIa4XDsoC3jurI7rxo2OL86-XXHMjYB5DzJ1PRmTdexqQgMg5H1AFJYVvJ1gU5Roz8) on Steller Sea Lion policy would be to ask whether you would prefer a status quo option that costs you $0 per year and that results in an endangered Steller Sea Lion population in Western Alaska that is 19,000 individuals smaller than today in 60 years time, or a plan that costs you $20 a year over 20 years that would result in an increase of 30,000 individuals and a downgraded endangered species status in 60 years. 

By varying the costs and the policy outcomes across surveys, environmental economists can assign a value to the component parts of the policy; e.g., people are willing to pay $X to increase the Steller Sea Lion population by 10,000 individuals and $Y to downgrade their endangered species status.

The problem is that because people don't actually purchase anything in the surveys, there's a lot of skepticism around whether people are answering in a way that makes sense. There's a lot of pieces to this, but some of the skepticism is about whether people actually account for the scope of the environmental policy - people might treat relatively small interventions and relatively large interventions similarly (e.g., completing restoring the Steller Sea Lion population might not be valued at much more than having its endangered species status downgraded). A way to convince the skeptics that these numbers are actually meaningful is to show that they're consistent. One of the ways consistency can be shown is through the adding-up test. For Steller Sea Lions, let's say the population is currently 45,000 individuals, and survey respondents indicate they're willing to pay $X to increase the population to 55,000 individuals and $Y to increase the population to 65,000 individuals, then people should be willing to pay $Y - $X to increase the population from 55,000 to 65,000, otherwise they're responses are inconsistent. But, are responses actually consisten? That's what Desvouges, Mathews, and Train are testing in the article. 

## Desvouges et al. (2015). An Adding-up Test on Contingent Valuations of River and Lake Quality
Rather than Steller Sea Lions, this paper focused on a river and lake system in Oklahoma, proposing adding alum to help clean-up poulty waste from the water system which would help accelerate other clean-up effort. It's actually piggy-backing on another study by Chapman, but that's not too important. Desvouges et al. randomly assigned each respondent to a proposed policy intervention, and, within each intervention, to a proposed price, and then asked whether the respondent would be willing to pay that price (this instrument is known as a single-bounded dichotomous referenda). 

The baseline scenario is a 60-year timeline for restoration of the lake, and a 50-year timeline for the restoration of the river, which wouldn't cost the respondent anything. Respondents were assigned to one of the following surveys that asked whether they were willing to pay for a policy:
* 1st increment: Accelerate restoration of river from 50 years to 10 years.
* 2nd increment: Accelerate restoration of lake from 60 years to 50 years.
* 3rd increment: Accelerate restoration of lake from 50 years to 40 years.
* 4th increment: Accelerate restoration of lake from 40 years to 20 years.
* Whole: Accelerate restoration of river from 50 years to 10 years, and lake from 60 years to 20 years.

The amount that the respondent was asked if they were willing to pay was randomly assigned to $10, $45, $80, $125, $205, or $405, and was specified as a lump sum payment (i.e., given out once rather than as an annual payment). 

Theoretically, the sum of the first four increments should equal the whole. But, Desvouges et al. finds that it doesn't, throwing some doubt onto contingent valuation, at least in this instance.
