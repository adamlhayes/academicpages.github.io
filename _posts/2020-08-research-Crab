There's an idea that shows up all the time that across difference strains of finance and economics more broadly that portfolio diversification insulates an individual or firm from shocks. The idea is that the more diversified you are, the more your returns look similar to overall total market returns. While you don't get super-high returns you also safe-guard against super-low returns. 

There's been some efforts over the past several years to apply this same idea to commercial fisheries. Very often a fishery is treated as a standalone thing, but a lot of commercial harvesters don't just harvest one species - they participate in multiple different fisheries. Dungeness Crab is a great example of this in California. Most of the vessels that harvest Dungeness Crab also harvest something else in the same year. Chinook Salmon (also called King Salmon) is the most common.
