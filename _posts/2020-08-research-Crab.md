## Summary
Does portfolio diversification insulate fisheries harvesters from risk like it protects investors in financial assets? We use the 2016 harmful algal bloom that delayed the start of the California Dungeness Crab season as a case study to examine how well diversification strategies insulated 

## Background
The risk-mitigating properties of portfolio diversification is an idea that has spilled over from financial investment studies into many threads of economics. The idea is that the more diversified you are, the more your returns look similar to overall total market returns. While you don't get super-high returns you also safe-guard against downside risk which could result in super-low returns. There's been some efforts over the past several years to apply this same idea to commercial fisheries. It's hypothesized that fishing portfolio diversification - fishing for more than just a single species - helps harvesters insulate themselves against the ups-and-downs of a fishery in much the same way that portfolio diversification helps investors insulate themselves from idiosyncratic volatility of a single investment.
